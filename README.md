- Changes to Rover max speed and torque values. Felt like the rover was useless once you had Hardsuit jetpack because it was so slow? Frustrated because a single 22.5 degree slope could stall out your sophisticicated space-exploring rover? Now you can explore much better. You don't even have to worry about falling off the edge of the map anymore like the old version...probably
- Default Settings are now 40m/s maximum speed and 2x torque of vanilla. Adjustable under BepInEx/configs once you run the game once.


## Requirements

**WARNING:** This is a StationeersLaunchPad Plugin Mod. It requires BepInEx to be installed with the StationeersLaunchPad plugin.

## Installation

2.  Install it from the workshop. Alternatively: Place the dll file into your `/BepInEx/plugins/` folder.
