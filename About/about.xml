        [h1]Beef's Rover Fixes[/h1]
        [b]WARNING:[/b] This is a StationeersLaunchPad Plugin Mod. It requires BepInEx to be installed with the StationeersLaunchPad plugin.
        See: https://github.com/StationeersLaunchPad/StationeersLaunchPad

        - Changes to Rover max speed and torque values. Felt like the rover was useless once you had Hardsuit jetpack because it was so slow? Frustrated because a single 22.5 degree slope could stall out your sophisticicated space-exploring rover? Now you can explore much better. You don't even have to worry about falling off the edge of the map anymore like the old version...probably
        - Default Settings are now 40m/s maximum speed and 2x torque of vanilla. Adjustable under BepInEx/configs once you run the game once.
